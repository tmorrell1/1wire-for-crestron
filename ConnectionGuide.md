For making connector you need a piece of single sided breadboard 11x5 holes, DB9 female connector, screw terminals for connecting to 1-wire bus, diodes and resistors.
1. Insert the breadboard between rows of pins DB9, so that the row with 5 pin was at the contacts side of breadboard, and solder connector pins.
2. Insert the diodes and resistors in the breadboard and bend their leads as shown in drawing «Top view». Solder leads as shown in drawing «Bottom view».
3. Insert screw terminals. Solder it pins.
4. Insert and solder wire for 24V.

If you have Crestron controller without DB9 connector for RS232, like DIN-AP3,  use a screw terminals instead DB9.
