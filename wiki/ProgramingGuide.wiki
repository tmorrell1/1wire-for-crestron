= Inputs =

||scan_addr||On rising edge receives sensor address and sends it into a serial join scanned_addr. Only one sensor must be connected in this procedure! Polling must be switched off in this time.||
|| polling||When its value is high, module polling of the values of all sensors.||
||rx$||It is a "rx$" serial join of the serial port.||
||addr$*[n*]||Address of the sensor in 1-wire bus.||

= Outputs =

||val_ok*[n*]||If it value is high, then connection with corresponding sensors is good and its value is correct.||
||ComSpec$||This serial join must be connected to Device Extender "Packet Transmission" of serial ports slot.||
||scanned_addr$||String with sensor address, received after pressing digital join "scan_addr".||
||tx$||It is a "tx$" serial join of the serial port.||
||val*[n*]||Temperature value of corresponding sensor. Value format XX.X.||

= Parameters =

||port||Select the port to which the signals  rx$ and tx$ are connected.||
||license||License key. Without license key module can work in demonstration mode during 1 hour. License key is associated with an address of first sensor. [https://code.google.com/p/1wire-for-crestron/wiki/GetLicense Read more about licensing ] ||

= Commissioning =

Firstly, you must connect each sensor separately and, pressing the "scan_addr" digital join, will get its address.Then you must paste this addresses in "Serial Send" symbol, connected to corresponding "addr$[n]" serial join in module. Then after compiling and downloading you can switch on digital join "polling" and get temperature values from sensor.
