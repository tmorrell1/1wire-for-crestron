License key is associated with an address of first sensor. To unlock the module, license key must match the configured address of the first sensor and the sensor should be polled on the 1-wire network. You have a demonstration period in 1 hour after restarting controller. In demonstration period module operates with full functionality.

Recommended to use first sensor only as a license key and connect it directly to the controller connector. You can also use it to control the temperature in your installation rack. 

For receiving a license key send me the address of the first sensor to crestron.ua@gmail.com.
